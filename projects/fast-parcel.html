  <h1>Fast Parcel         <a href="https://fastparcel.in"><img src="/Portfolio/assets/web.svg" width="22"></a></h1>

  <p>
  Fast Parcel started as an attempt to solve problems I had already seen
  firsthand: opaque pricing, poor communication between systems, and
  fragile workflows that break under real operational pressure. Working
  inside logistics made it obvious that many tools are built without a
  clear understanding of how operations actually run day to day.
</p>

<p>
  While exploring the idea, I had to think about constraints beyond code:
  margins, delivery timelines, reliability expectations, and the cost of
  failure when things go wrong in production. Even without a working
  backend, these constraints shaped how I thought about the system as a
  whole.
</p>

<p>
  Attempting to build the application using AI exposed the limits of
  abstraction-driven development. I could generate pieces of code, but
  without understanding how requests flow, how state is managed, or how
  services interact, those pieces never formed a coherent system.
</p>

<p>
  This project forced me to confront the gap between assembling features
  and building software that can survive real-world usage. It made clear
  that learning fundamentals such as HTTP, APIs, runtimes, and deployment
  is not optional if you want to build systems that last.
</p>

<p>
  Fast Parcel remains an unfinished product, but a valuable learning
  project. It reshaped how I approach software: starting with constraints,
  understanding the underlying mechanics, and treating tools as helpers
  rather than substitutes for knowledge.
