  <h1>Fast Parcel         <a href="https://fastparcel.in"><img src="/Portfolio/assets/web.svg" width="22"></a></h1>

<p>
  Fast Parcel emerged from problems I observed working in logistics: 
  opaque pricing structures, disconnected systems that failed to 
  communicate, and workflows that collapsed under operational load. 
  These experiences revealed that many logistics tools are designed 
  without understanding daily operational realities.
</p>

<p>
  Developing the concept required considering operational constraints: 
  profit margins, delivery windows, reliability thresholds, and failure 
  costs. These constraints shaped my system design even before writing 
  any backend code.
</p>

<p>
  Building with AI-generated code exposed the limits of abstraction-driven 
  development. I could generate code fragments, but without understanding 
  request flows, state management, or service interactions, these fragments 
  never coalesced into a functional system.
</p>

<p>
  This project exposed the gap between assembling features and building 
  production-ready software. It demonstrated that understanding fundamentals—
  HTTP, APIs, runtime environments, and deployment—is essential for creating 
  systems that withstand real-world use.
</p>

<p>
  Fast Parcel remains an unfinished product, but a valuable learning
  project. It reshaped how I approach software: starting with constraints,
  understanding the underlying mechanics, and treating tools as helpers
  rather than substitutes for knowledge.
