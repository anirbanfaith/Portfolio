  <h1>Fast Parcel</h1>

  <p>
    Before the tariff situation between India and the USA, I wanted to build
    a shipping and logistics service for Indian exporters.
  </p>

  <p>
    I’ve worked more than four years in logistics. Trying to build this product
    exposed me to pricing models, APIs, system constraints, and the cost of
    failures in production environments.
  </p>

  <p>
    I initially relied on AI to build the application and failed. That failure
    made it clear that without understanding fundamentals, tools can’t help you.
    This became my motivation to learn programming seriously.
