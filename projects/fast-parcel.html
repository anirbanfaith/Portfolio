  <p>
  Before the tariff situation between India and the USA, I was interested
  (and still am) in building a shipping and logistics service focused on
  Indian exporters. The idea came from working closely with existing
  logistics providers and seeing where the systems break down in practice.
</p>

<p>
  I’ve spent more than four years in the logistics sector, dealing with
  pricing, fulfillment, coordination, and the realities of operating
  time-sensitive systems. At some point, relying entirely on current
  providers felt limiting, so I decided to explore what it would take to
  build something of my own. A big move, especially with zero software
  background.
</p>

<p>
  Since I wasn’t a developer, I leaned heavily on AI to get started.
  With its help, I built a simple marketing site for Fast Parcel and
  hosted it using Cloudflare Pages. That part worked. Building the
  actual application did not.
</p>

<p>
  I tried and failed to create the full system using AI alone. That failure
  made one thing clear: without understanding fundamentals, tools can only
  take you so far. If you don’t know how things work underneath, neither AI
  nor anyone else can help you build something reliable.
</p>

<p>
  That experience became my motivation to start learning programming
  seriously, with a focus on understanding systems rather than just
  assembling features.
